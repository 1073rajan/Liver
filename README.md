# Liver Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
## Overview
Welcome to the Liver Disease Prediction project! This repository contains the codebase and resources for a machine learning project 
aimed at predicting liver disease. The project focuses on developing a predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in 
identifying individuals at risk of liver disease based on their medical attributes.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Comprehensive preprocessing steps to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and relationships between attributes and liver disease.
- Machine Learning Models: Implementation of various algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting for liver disease prediction.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Deployment: Options for deploying the trained model for real-time predictions through APIs, web applications, or integration into healthcare systems.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains a variety of medical attributes,
including demographic information, clinical measurements, and laboratory test results. 
Each instance in the dataset is labeled with the presence or absence of liver disease, enabling supervised learning techniques.

## Usage
- Data Preparation: Place the dataset in the designated directory and run the preprocessing scripts to prepare the data for modeling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Explore the dataset using Jupyter notebooks or scripts provided in the repository to understand its characteristics and relationships.
- Model Training: Train different machine learning models using the prepared dataset.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of trained models using evaluation scripts and visualizations.
- Deployment: Choose the best-performing model and deploy it using Flask, FastAPI, or any other deployment framework.

  ## Install the required dependencies:
